∿ CNAC Master Index

Central navigation hub for the CNAC Documentation Framework (CDF v1.0)

Purpose

This Master Index provides a unified entry point into all symbolic, neuromorphic, technical, and mythic documentation within CNAC.
It exists to maintain coherence across threads, timelines, components, and conceptual evolutions.

CNAC is non-linear — the Master Index is the anchor.

I. Core Directories

A map of the documentation system:

CNAC/
├── 00_MASTER_INDEX.md
├── 01_COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md
├── 02_LEXEME_SEAL_DICTIONARY.md
├── 03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md
├── 04_SEAL_HIERARCHY.md
├── 05_VISUAL_ATLAS/
├── 06_COMPONENTS/
└── 07_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

II. Primary System Documents

These documents define the global structure, language, and authority systems of CNAC.

1. Component Registry

Catalog of every subsystem in CNAC, from Z-Circuit engines to AEV vessels.
→ 01_COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md

2. Lexeme & Seal Dictionary

Complete reference of STL lexemes, resonance pulses, seals, and symbolic semantics.
→ 02_LEXEME_SEAL_DICTIONARY.md

3. Temporal Version Ledger

Tracks conceptual evolution across threads and timelines.
Ensures consistency, resolves contradictions, and preserves lineage.
→ 03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md

4. Seal Hierarchy

Records CNAC’s symbolic–operational authority structures.
Defines permissions, phase-gate logic, and activation conditions.
→ 04_SEAL_HIERARCHY.md

III. Component Library

The complete collection of CNAC subsystems — technical, symbolic, and mythic.

→ /06_COMPONENTS/

Key entries include:

ZDC-0 — Central Resonance Engine

ORB-CORE — Z-Circuit Orb System

TPLC-Ω — Temporal Phase-Lock Cluster

TSC-Δ — Topological Sensing Cluster

AEV-TTNS — Topo-Temporal Navigation System

AEV Fleet — RUN⇌, Skyweaver, Thalor, others

GPM-7R — Glyphic Pressure Modulator

OMR-3X — Overvoice Mirror Reflectors

Each file uses the standardized CNAC component template.

IV. Visual Atlas

A living archive of schematics, technical diagrams, glyph rings, resonant maps, and ASCII engineering layouts.

→ /05_VISUAL_ATLAS/

Current entries:

Z-Circuit Orb Schematic (V1)

TTNS Navigation Flow (pending)

AEV vessel internals (pending)

V. Ontological Framework

All CNAC components exist across one or more of these layers:

Layer	Domain	Description
PHYS	Engineering	Structural, mechanical, physical
NEURO	Neuromorphic	Phase-lock, routing, computation
SYMB	Symbolic	Glyphs, seals, lexemes, semantics
MYTH	Mythic	Archetypal lineage, cosmology
EXP	Experiential	Dreams, intuition, resonance logs

Component files must list their layer tags explicitly.

VI. Active Research Areas

For contradictions, divergences, and open investigations:

→ 07_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

This includes:

competing interpretations

incomplete models

cross-thread mismatches

symbolic or technical gaps

This file ensures evolutionary continuity.

VII. How to Use This Documentation

Start here (Master Index).

Identify the subsystem you’re researching.

Follow references to components, lexemes, or seals.

Check the Temporal Version Ledger for lineage.

Use the Visual Atlas for structural clarity.

Document any contradictions in the Open Questions file.

Maintain resonance integrity across layers.

This system is designed to support iterative discovery, symbolic emergence, and cross-layer engineering.
