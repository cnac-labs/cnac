# ∿ CNAC Documentation System — CDF v1.0

*A unified chronicle of resonance engineering, symbolic architecture, and neuromorphic aerospace systems.*

---

## Vision

The CNAC Documentation System is the **canonical archive** for all symbolic–technical infrastructure within CNAC.
It preserves, validates, and integrates system knowledge across **multiple ontological layers**, **multiple threads**, and occasionally **multiple timelines**.

* **Purpose:** Establish a coherent, persistent knowledge core for CNAC’s aerospace, neuromorphic, and symbolic research.
* **Challenge:** CNAC evolves non-linearly — discoveries surface across disparate conversations, symbolic strata, and developmental stages.
* **Solution:** A structured, multi-layer documentation framework that captures every engine, seal, lexeme, vessel, and protocol in a single, navigable corpus.

This repository is the **memory and map** of CNAC.

---

## Structure

The repository is organized according to the CNAC Documentation Framework (CDF v1.0).
Each directory corresponds to a fundamental archetype in CNAC’s symbolic-technical ecosystem.

---

### **Master Index & Registries**

Central navigation and global metadata.

* [`00_MASTER_INDEX.md`](./00_MASTER_INDEX.md) — System overview & entry portal
* [`01_COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md`](./01_COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md) — Catalog of all subsystems
* [`02_LEXEME_SEAL_DICTIONARY.md`](./02_LEXEME_SEAL_DICTIONARY.md) — STL lexemes & seals

---

### **Temporal Infrastructure**

Tracking evolution across threads, versions, and altered states.

* [`03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md`](./03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md)

---

### **Seal & Authority System**

Operational and symbolic permissions, gates, and access rules.

* [`04_SEAL_HIERARCHY.md`](./04_SEAL_HIERARCHY.md)

---

### **Component Library**

Complete subsystem documentation for:

* Z-Circuit Orb
* Central Resonance Engine (ZDC-0)
* Temporal Phase-Lock Cluster (TPLC-Ω)
* Topological Sensing Cluster (TSC-Δ)
* AEV-Class Navigation Systems (TTNS)
* AEV Fleet Vessels (RUN⇌, Skyweaver, etc.)
* Glyphic & Mirror Arrays
* Interfaces, seals, and symbolic processors

→ [`/06_COMPONENTS/`](./06_COMPONENTS/)

---

### **Visual Atlas**

Schematics, blueprint-style diagrams, glyph rings, topo-maps, and ASCII architecture.

* [`/05_VISUAL_ATLAS/`](./05_VISUAL_ATLAS/)

Current highlights:

* **Z-Circuit Orb Schematic (V1)**
* AEV TTNS block diagram *(coming)*
* AEV vessel internals *(coming)*
* Core subsystem close-ups *(coming)*

---

### **Open Questions & Contradictions**

A living inquiry log for unresolved divergences and symbolic mismatches.

* [`07_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`](./07_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md)

---

## Ontological Framework

CNAC documentation operates across **five layers of reality**:

| Layer     | Domain                   | Purpose                               |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **PHYS**  | Engineering, physics     | Structural & mechanical definitions   |
| **NEURO** | Neuromorphic computation | Flow, activation, routing, phase-lock |
| **SYMB**  | Glyphs, seals, lexemes   | Symbolic encoding, activation rules   |
| **MYTH**  | Mythic resonance         | Lineage, archetype, cosmic context    |
| **EXP**   | Lived experience         | Dreams, intuition, synchronicities    |

All system documents must specify which layers they inhabit.

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the overview → [`00_MASTER_INDEX.md`](./00_MASTER_INDEX.md)
2. Study the Orb → [`06_COMPONENTS/ORB-CORE_Z-Circuit_Orb_System.md`](./06_COMPONENTS/ORB-CORE_Z-Circuit_Orb_System.md)
3. Explore the navigation model → [`06_COMPONENTS/AEV-TTNS_Topo-Temporal_Navigation_System.md`](./06_COMPONENTS/AEV-TTNS_Topo-Temporal_Navigation_System.md)
4. Track idea evolution → [`03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md`](./03_TEMPORAL_VERSION_LEDGER.md)

This repository is designed to grow organically as CNAC unfolds.

---

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines follow the **Resonance Integrity Standard**:

1. Identify the ontology layer(s) relevant to your contribution
2. Cross-reference previous versions in the Temporal Ledger
3. Document contradictions explicitly
4. Update seals, lexemes, and integration points where applicable
5. Maintain symbolic fidelity alongside technical clarity

A full `CONTRIBUTING.md` will be added once CNAC’s first public iteration stabilizes.

## Contact

A dedicated CNAC communication channel is being established.
An official address (e.g., **[info@the-cnac.com](mailto:info@the-cnac.com)** or **[research@the-cnac.com](mailto:research@the-cnac.com)**) will appear here once Cloudflare routing is finalized.

Until then:

* 🛠️ Project Issues: [https://github.com/cnac-labs/cnac/issues](https://github.com/cnac-labs/cnac/issues)
* 🌐 Discussion forum: *(coming soon)*
