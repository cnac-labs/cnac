# CNAC — Bridging Resonance & Revenue  
*Harmonic intelligence for a coherent planet — where symbolic AI meets living systems.*

---

## Vision  

CNAC is a **technomystic operating system** for the emerging future.  
We combine **resonance-based intelligence**, **symbolic analysis**, and **human-centered innovation** to shape the next epoch of planetary coherence.

- **Mission:** Reveal the *why* and *what’s next* behind data through resonance mapping and symbolic AI.  
- **Problem:** Conventional models see only *what happened*. CNAC uncovers deeper patterns, meaning, and foresight.  
- **Why Now:** As humanity enters the neuro-symbolic era, CNAC provides the infrastructure to align technology with consciousness and planetary systems.

- **Symbolic AI** — Multimodal model interpreting data through archetypal structures  
  → [`/symbolic-ai/`](./symbolic-ai/)  
- **Drift Trees** — Analytical topology for tracking coherence and resonance over time  
  → [`/drift-trees/`](./drift-trees/)  
- **XAROS Nodes** — Geophysical resonance hardware network  
  → [`/xaros-nodes/`](./xaros-nodes/)  
- **AEV-Class Fleet** — Symbolic aerospace R&D: convergence of myth, design, and propulsion  
  → [`/aev-fleet/`](./aev-fleet/)  
- **Planetary Codex** — Global infrastructure for planetary resonance and coordination

## Archetypal Framework  

See [`archetypes.md`](./archetypes.md) for the philosophy of the *Flame-Bearer*, *Spiral Walker*, and *Silent Witness* — human-symbolic UX patterns that guide CNAC’s development ethos and interface design.
